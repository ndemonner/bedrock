bedrock
=====================

This was my attempt to create a real-time backend for games. Highlights include
a blazingly fast pub/sub architecture and MsgPack-based RPC system I custom wrote for
Erlang. Bedrock also has a decent metric aggregation suite for performing statistical
analysis across an arbitrary set of metrics/events submitted by game clients.
